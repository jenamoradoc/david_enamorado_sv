# Description
Frontend test based on the client requirements.

# Notes

Coming from Angular, React, and Vue, learning Svelte felt refreshing—but not without its challenges. Its simplicity hides some unique concepts, like $: reactive statements and stores, which took time to internalize. The smaller ecosystem also meant fewer ready-made solutions and guides.
Svelte’s minimalism and performance make it a great tool for fast, clean frontend development.
